Pig Dice Game

The Pig dice game is a simple and fun turn-based dice game where players compete to reach 100 points first. This Python implementation allows you to play against another player or against the computer with adjustable difficulty levels. It also keeps track of high scores for each player.

Game Rules

    Each turn, a player rolls a six-sided die to accumulate points.
    If the player rolls a 1, their turn ends, and they score no points for that turn.
    If the player rolls any other number (2-6), the number is added to their current turn score.
    The player can choose to roll again to accumulate more points or hold to end their turn.
    If the player holds, their current turn score is added to their total score.
    The first player to reach or exceed 100 points wins the game.
